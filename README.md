#Road-Safety-Analysis
 The project included data cleaning, transformation, and analysis of a road accident dataset in order to uncover great insights.
 Designed an interactive dashboard using Power bi that represented accident trends, severity, and location-based patterns. 
 This project honed my skills in data cleaning, SQL, and data visualization
